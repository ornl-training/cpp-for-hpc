    "`std::vector` is a container describing a contiguous piece of **\"typed\"** (_e.g._ `float`, `int`, custom objects) memory. Access can be done through indices, or iterators making it the preferred container to get performance in HPC systems due to its vectorization and cache friendly (zero per-element indexing overhead) characteristics. `std::vector` containers are heap-allocated allowing for flexible reallocations if required. For stack-allocated containers see `std::array`. \n",
