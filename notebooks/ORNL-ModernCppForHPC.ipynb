    "ORNL’s training introduction to modern C++ for high-performance computing (HPC) applications. The goal is to expose the audience to the features of modern C++ and how they can be used and exploited considering performance aspects. We’d attempt to cover the gap between C++ general programming resources and computer science topics in HPC.\n",
    "\n",
    "Topics covered: memory management, input/output I/O, STL containers, RAII, parallel algorithms, move semantics, threads, combining MPI and modern C++, GPU programming using Nvidia CUDA and Thrust, and AMD ROC.\n",

    "Much of the material is from:\n",

    "- Strostroup's [The C++ Programming Language 4th Edition](https://www.stroustrup.com/4th.html)\n",
